I am a research assitant at the [Computer Vision Lab of Academia Sinica, Taiwan](https://www.iis.sinica.edu.tw/~liutyng/), working on single image view 3D mesh reconstruction with [Prof. Liu Tyng-Luh](https://www.iis.sinica.edu.tw/pages/liutyng/). During my undergraduate, I worked with [Prof. Chi-Keung TANG](http://www.cs.ust.hk/~cktang) and [Prof. Yu-Wing TAI](https://www.cse.ust.hk/admin/people/faculty/profile/yuwing) at the [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST)](https://www.cse.ust.hk). I have recently graduated from HKUST with a First Class Honor in Computer Science.

### HAA500: Human-Centric Atomic Action Dataset with Curated Videos
We contribute HAA500, a manually annotated human-centric atomic action dataset for action recognition on 500 classes with over 591k labeled frames. HAA500 contains fine-grained atomic actions where only consistent actions fall under the same label. HAA500 has been carefully curated to capture the movement of human figures with less spatio-temporal label noises to greatly enhance the training of deep neural networks. Our extensive experiments validate the benefits of human-centric and atomic characteristics of HAA, which enables the trained model to improve prediction by attending to atomic human poses.
