I am a research assitant at the Computer Vision Lab of Academia Sinica, Taiwan, working on single image view 3D mesh reconstruction. During my undergraduate, I worked with Prof. Chi-Keung TANG and Prof. Yu-Wing TAI at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST). I have recently graduated from HKUST with a First Class Honor in Computer Science.
